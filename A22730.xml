            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS Wee haue heretofore publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſeuerall Commiſſions, with Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Directions to you Our Maſter
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:178064:3"/> and Councell of Our Court of Wards and Liueries, for compounding for Wards, Ideots and Lunatiques, now that time and experience haue produced the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſundry defects, that otherwiſe could not eaſily haue been foreſeene, which are to bee ſupplied by explanation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the ſame Our Inſtructions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Our gracious purpoſe for the good of Our louing Subiects, &amp; Our eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall care for the true anſwering of Our Reuenues. And forſomuch as it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by common experience, in the courſe which hath beene helde ſince the firſt erection of Our Court of Wards and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, That partly by the ſlackeneſſe of the Friends of the Wards, vpon the deceaſe of the Parents or Anceſtours, who haue forborne to offer timely Compoſition, ſometimes with opinion, that no Tytle could be found for Vs, and ſomtimes with purpoſe to ſuppreſſe the ſame, &amp; partly by the ſuite of other men, the Cuſtodie of the bodies and lands of Our Wards, haue been committed to ſuch perſons, ſome for one

            <p>And whereas alſo Wee haue bene infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by you the Maſter of the ſaide Court, that by reaſon of the great difficulties that haue bene found by the Court, vpon ſight of Offices, and Surueyes only, to ſet downe Compoſitions for Wardſhips and Leaſes of Wards Lands, with ſuch equalitie and moderation betweene Vs, and Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, as were iuſt and reaſonable; and that through want of due information in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:178064:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> that behalfe, much of the profit that might haue bene raiſed for Vs, hath bene diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to diuers Sutors and Committees, who by obſcuring the trueth of the Wards eſtate, and by miſinforming of the Court therein, haue reaped greater profite, then was intended, if you could by ordinary meanes, haue come by the knowledge of their values; ſo as, both Wee haue receiued leſſe then otherwiſe We ſhould haue done, and the Wards found little eaſe in many caſes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, for the preuenting of theſe and the like inconueniences, and to the end that Our louing Subiects may ſtand aſſured, that Wee deſire nothing more, then that their Children and their Lands; that ſhall fall vnto Vs by reaſon of Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, might after their deceaſe, bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their neereſt and truſtieſt friends, or to ſuch as they, by Wil, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, commit the charge vnto, vpon ſuch valuable conſiderations, as are iuſt and reaſonable: And to the intent that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Anceſtours may depart in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:178064:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> peace, in hope of this Our gracious fauour; and their friendes may ſee their Children brought vp in pietie and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and may take ſuch care as is fit, for the preſeruation of their inheritance, if they wil ſeeke the ſame in time, and by ſuch meanes as are fitte and conuenient; Wee haue thought good hereby to require you, the Maſter and Councell of the ſaid Court for the time beeing, that in diſpoſing and committing of the cuſtodie of the Bodies and Lands of ſuch Our Wards, whoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours are already deceaſed, or ſhall die from and after the date of theſe preſents, and of ſuch Ideots and Lunatiques, and their Eſtates, as ſhall fall vnto Vs from hencefoorth, you ſhal ſtrictly and carefully obſerue theſe Our Directions following.</p>
